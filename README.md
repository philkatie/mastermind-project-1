# Taylor Swift's Masters Mind

## Description

Mastermind is a code breaking game. The game generates a secret 4-character code and the player is given 8 tries to guess the code.

After each guess is submitted, the game reveals how many elements of the player's code are either a correct element in a correct space or a correct element in an incorrect space. This is a lot like Wordle if you're familiar - but unlike Wordle, the reveals are not tied to any specific element. So, the game would tell you **that** you have two guesses in the correct space and a third in an incorrect space, but not **which** guess corresponds to which reveal.

My Mastermind game is Taylor Swift themed, because I was listening to Taylor Swift when I started brainstorming and it made me think of a stupid pun (this is probably going to become a theme in my work tbh). Taylor Swift is in the process of rerecording her first 6 albums because she does not own the Master recordings of each album. But she won't have to finish rerecording her albums if we can break her Masters out of the vault at her old record label!

In Taylor Swift's Masters Mind, if we can come up with the correct secret code, we can gain access to her first six albums! This would be a personal tragedy for me because I want the extra songs that she is releasing with the rerecordings, but sometimes we just have to make sacrifices for the greater good.

There are Taylor Swift Easter Eggs throughout the game, like the lyric-themed win and lose messages that appear at the end of each game. This game is truly a labor of love and also of me being insufferable!
